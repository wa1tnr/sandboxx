It was unclear which LCD library was preferred, when
this project was constructed (in February 2022).

The lib was chosen based on what someone else had
asked about; there is an internal LCD library in
the Arduino IDE that may or may not be a close
match to this lib (this wasn't checked at all).

The Arduino IDE stores at least one version of
this library; in the reference PC's installation,
this was found here:

    ~/arduino-1.8.19/libraries/LiquidCrystal/

Comparison is left to the end-user to perform,
as the present project is working fine as-is. ;)
